## What is it?
For those who love food and eat out A LOT but have trouble keeping track of where and what they ate, this application can help! More Food For Thought is a personal tracker for restaurants and food. Each user can input a restaurant and log the food they ate as well as any relevant notes. At any point, they can dishes to restaurants and modify the data as needed.

## Planning
My plan for this project was to create a one to many relationship between the user and restaurants as well as a one to many relationship between a restaurant and it's dishes. I planned to use error driven development when creating the code.

## Future Iterations
In future iterations, I would like to add the ability to search for a single restaurant using the restaurant name vs. the restaurant id.

Additionally, I would like to use the OpenReadController so you can see other users' restaurant and food data.

## Development and Problem Solving
In the beginning stages of the project, I had a tough time understanding the nested relationships and visualizing how the data would be returned. I ended up whiteboarding the data representation and keeping it nearby as I created the macros and established the relationships between the restaurant and food resources. This made it much easier interact with and manipulate the data as I moved through development.
